# Bulk Image Optimize or Compress - Console Client


This project is based on https://github.com/madskristensen/ImageOptimizer by Mads Kristensen, which is basically Visual Studio Extension, 
which enables developers to optimize/compress images in Visual Studio IDE.

With this project, you can bulk compress or optimize images inside any folder. You may have folder inside folder with images, this project works for this case too.

Production Tested: I have used it to bulk compress images on production environment.

Download Setup: https://github.com/itorian/BulkImageOptimizeOrCompress/blob/master/ImageCompressorConsole/dist/version-1.zip

Note: I noticed that Seqrite antivirus prompted me to allow this software when I was compressing images, this is because it operates on files directly.
